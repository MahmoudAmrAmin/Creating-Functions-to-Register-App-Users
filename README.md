# 🛡️ User Registration System – Input Validation with Python

A robust and reusable Python-based input validation system to improve the user registration flow for a mobile application. This project ensures only valid and well-formatted user data is accepted during the sign-up process, significantly enhancing data integrity and user experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an initiative to improve the registration system for a mobile app at a startup. The goal was to minimize invalid sign-up attempts and enforce consistency in user input through server-side validation.

### ✅ What This Project Does:
- Validates email format, password strength, and username requirements
- Automatically approves or rejects sign-up attempts based on validation
- Enhances overall user onboarding quality
- Uses clean, modular, and reusable Python functions

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Email Validation**: Ensures correct email format using regex
- **Password Validation**: Enforces minimum length, complexity, and character variety
- **Username Checks**: Verifies allowed characters and length constraints
- **Reusable Functions**: All validators are modular and ready for integration into larger systems
- **Scalable Structure**: Designed with growth in mind for future onboarding improvements

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Regular Expressions (`re`)
- Optional: Unit Testing (`unittest` or `pytest`)

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from validators.email_validator import is_valid_email
from validators.password_validator import is_strong_password
from validators.username_validator import is_valid_username

if is_valid_email(user_email) and is_strong_password(user_password) and is_valid_username(user_name):
    print("Registration successful!")
else:
    print("Registration failed. Please check your input.")
    

## 📈 Impact

By integrating these validation functions into the mobile app's sign-up flow, this project has:

- 🚫 **Reduced invalid registrations** by enforcing strict input validation.
- 👥 **Improved the user onboarding experience** through real-time feedback and clear requirements.
- 🧹 **Enhanced backend data hygiene** by ensuring only well-formatted and complete data enters the system.
